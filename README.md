## **Introduction**

Stack Overflow, the world's largest online developer community, has been a critical resource for programmers since its launch in 2008. It enables users to share knowledge, solve technical problems, and grow their expertise through a collaborative question-and-answer model. However, the recent rise of AI-driven tools like ChatGPT has influenced how users seek programming solutions, leading to decreased engagement and shifts in user behavior on the platform.

This project, **Overflowytics**, aims to analyze Stack Overflow user data to understand activity trends, identify engagement patterns, and assess the impact of AI on the platform. By leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, the project provides insights into reputation dynamics, user retention, and future challenges for sustaining an active developer community.
